        I passed the Matriculation Examination in Myanmar with 5 Distinctions across 6 Subjects in 2016 with great
        scores in <b className="font-semibold">Maths</b>(98/100) and <b className="font-semibold">Physics</b>(92/100).
        Those marks probably mean nothing by now, I just wanted to show my foundations of critical thinking and Maths.
        <br />
        <br /> This allowed me to enroll <b className="font-semibold">Yangon Technological University</b>, one of the
        best engineering universities in Myanmar. I applied for the Computer Engineering & Information Technology Major
        and got accepted.

        After dropping out at <span className="font-medium text-lg">[Year 2]</span> to pursue my career and passion, I

        FreeCodeCamp.

        Afterwards, I studied for a year at Turing Programming Language Center under Mr. Thet Khine, a well-respected
        software engineer in our programming field.

        Since I landed my first job as a developer in 2022, I have been self-studying supportive academic skills for
        software engineering such as <b className="font-semibold">Discrete Mathematics</b>,{" "}
        <b className="font-semibold">Linear Algebra</b>, and <b className="font-semibold">Computer Science</b>, using
        online resources.
