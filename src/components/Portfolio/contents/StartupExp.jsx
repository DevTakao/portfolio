        In June 2020, together with 3 other teammates, we won a startup challenge by Phandeeyar under the title of
        &ldquo;Back To Business&rdquo;. The mission of this challenge was to innovate a digital solution that would
        revive local SMEs in Myanmar that halted due to the effects of COVID-19 Outbreak.
        <br />
        <br />
        We founded a startup called <b className="font-semibold">Myan Digital</b> with the prize money, which promoted
        the digital literacy of local shop owners, helped them digitize their workflows and open up online sale channels
        to bring back revenue streams.
        <br />
        <br />I took the role of executive management and creatives, and accelerated our company to achieve at least 250
        happy clients in the first 4 months. It was a good team! Unfortunately, the coup in Myanmar that happened soon
        afterwards shut our business down.
