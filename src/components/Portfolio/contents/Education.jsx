        First and foremost, I must say I am very grateful to be exposed to great education in my childhood. There were
        many really inspiring teachers in my early life that I can remember. They are the foundation of my critical
        thinking, academic excellence and self-esteem.
        <strong className="font-semibold"> Thank you, my parents and teachers.</strong>

        <br />I passed the Matriculation Examination in Myanmar with 5 Distinctions across 6 Subjects in 2016 with
        flying colors.
        <br />
        <br /> This allowed me to enroll <b className="font-semibold">Yangon Technological University</b>, one of the
        best engineering universities in Myanmar. I applied for the Computer Engineering & Information Technology Major
        and got accepted.

        However, after a few months, I felt that the syllabus for my major was not worth to spend 6 years on. So I
        dropped out at <span className="font-medium text-lg">[Year 2]</span> to pursue my career and passion for
        softwares and games. I started studying Web Development myself for around 2 years and received some certificates
        in the following courses at FreeCodeCamp.

      <ul className="list-disc px-6 pb-6">
        <li>Responsive Web Design</li>
        <li>JavaScript Data Structure & Algorithms</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="pb-6">
        Afterwards, I studied for a year at Turing Programming Language Center under Mr. Thet Khine, a well-respected
        software engineer in our programming field. I learnt how to be a great thinker and programmer from his lectures.

        Since I landed my first job as a developer in 2022, I have been extending my abilites by learning new skills
        such as Cloud Solutions and Mobile App Development, and complementary academics such as{" "}
        <b className="font-semibold">Design Patterns</b>, <b className="font-semibold">Linear Algebra</b>, and{" "}
        <b className="font-semibold">Computer Science</b>, using online resources.
